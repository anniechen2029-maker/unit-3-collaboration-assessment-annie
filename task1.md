# short response 
question 1
 We would use these three command s "git add ." "git commmit -m" then "git push" because if we would want merge would have save our branch then merge it to the main .

 question 2
  Developers use branchs because they wouldnt want to effect the main if something happens using a branch keep the main safe.

  question 3 
  Git is a command line tool that allows us to track and manage changes to our code. Github is a web based platfrom to store repos in the cloud and let use collab with developers.Both git and github works together by github having a cloud and have git repository hosting service .

  question 4 
   The commands are in the wrong orders because we wouldnt use git commit -m first we would need to use the command git add . to save our work so the correct order would be " git add ." then "git commit -m 'message'" then "git push"
